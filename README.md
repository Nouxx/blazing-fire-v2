# Blazing fire

An all-in-one application to manage your diet, reducing friction when finding appropriate daily meals, so you can focus on your life while keeping your inner fire blazing!

## Cheatsheet

### Pre-requisite

- `Node` and `pnpm`
- `supabase` CLI (as the npm package `supabase` installation does not provide any bin, [source](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/11851))

### `pnpm` 101

```bash
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact
pnpm install
pnpm dev # runs the "dev" script in package.json
```

### Dev

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Supabase

```bash
supabase start # or stop
```
